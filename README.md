# hello-world
This is my first repo. and first time using git hub!! yay \O/

Hello, 

My name is Diana Benavides and I am a computer science major! 
I like to listen to music and I sometimes write and sing for fun with some friends. 
I got into computer science during high school when I participated in youth organization 
called GirlSource and created webpages of social issues that affect the community 
especially young girls. I gain leadership experience as well as hands on experience 
in creating a webpage with html. Since then I have been eager to learn and explore different 
ways to use a virtual platform for a good cause.
